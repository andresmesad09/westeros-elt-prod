# Westeros ELT project

This is a ELT project to apply of the knowledge about GCP. Westeros is a ficticious company that has data on a MySQL database and a file that is being stored in a Compute Engine Instance.

# About the infrastructure

- We use `gsutil cp` command to copy the `csv` file from the instance to the Cloud Storage Bucket.
- Cloud Functions are a serverless solution that along with Cloud Scheduler, make a great decision for simple pipelines and allow the company to save money because it will be billed for the functionâ€™s execution time, and you can keep them as simple as possible.
